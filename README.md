# K_means_clustering-with-iris-data
An unsupervised machine learning algorithm is K Means clustering. Neural Networks provide an illustration of a supervised learning algorithm since both the inputs (x) and the outputs were used in the learning process (y). The difference between the expected result and the actual result (y) is used to train the system during the learning process. The result (y) variable is not used during training in an unsupervised approach like K Means clustering.  Using the IRIS dataset, we examine the following in this example:  the sample IRIS dataset being imported transforming it into a Pandas Dataframe Using scatter plots to visualise the categories basic performance indicators
